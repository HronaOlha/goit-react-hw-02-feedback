# goit-react-hw-02-feedback

## Task

Create an application for collecting statistics. There are only three options for feedback: good, neutral and bad.

- The application should display the number of reviews collected for each category.
- The application should not store feedback statistics between different sessions (page refreshes).
- Add a display of the total number of collected reviews from all categories and the percentage of positive reviews. 
- The statistics block is rendered only after at least one feedback has been collected.
